The model is tuned to have a minimal possible height, i.e. the connectors of the HiFi Berry sound card have be 
be removed. 

However, the model can be paramterizes in its size (e.g. the height), material thickness, etc.

See [source](./parts/pedalboard-case.scad#L5-L12) for some of the interesting paramteters.
